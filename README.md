# PriorityQueues
Priority Queues implemented with a GUI.

## About
The project mimics a hospital setting, where patients are assigned different priorities based on the severity of their condition.
The severities are then used to reorder the tree, that way whenever the queue is popped the patient with highest priority is taken.

## Setup and Installation
Setup file in build directory

## Tools
The UI was built with Jetpack Compose for Desktop. Note that this was one of the earliest releases of Jetpack Compose as such there may be breaking changes in current versions. Use the version specified in project files to build the project.
